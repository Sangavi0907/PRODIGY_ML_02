A varied consumer base with a range of purchasing habits makes it difficult for retail establishments to tailor their marketing campaigns efficiently. The retail establishment can enhance its client base and sales by customising its marketing techniques according to the unique requirements and preferences of individual customer segments, which are formed by grouping clients based on their past purchases. To find trends and commonalities among customers, the project will analyse purchase history data. Customers will be divided into segments with comparable purchasing patterns using K-means clustering. After then, these segments will be examined in order to determine the characteristics and preferences of every group.
